In order to run **MANGA**, some modules for the **Python compiler** must be installed. You have to open the **prompt** for this. You can easily find it by searching for it by typing **"Command Prompt"** and opening it with a **mouse click**. Since MANGA is a line program, everything happens at the command prompt (see figure 1).

Now the following modules ***numpy***, ***vtk***, ***lxml*** and ***matplotlib*** must be installed. We start with the **module** ***numpy***. Type the code shown in the **prompt** to install the **module** (see Figure 2).

	• py -3.7 -m pip install numpy						     		[1]

Do the same for the other three **modules** with the following code

	• py -3.7 -m pip install vtk						     		[2]
	• py -3.7 -m pip install lxml					  	     		[3]
	• py -3.7 -m pip install matplotlib					     		[4]

Note: If the prompt says that ***pip*** is not up to date, you can use **upgrade** ***pip*** to update it. However, this is not mandatory.

Some explenations: ***py*** means you are calling **Python**. Where **-3.7** is the version you are using. ***-m*** means you are calling a module, in this case ***pip***, which is used to install other **modules**. Finally, the **module** **name** of the **module** to be installed follows. Now the preparations for using the **compiler** are finished. As a next step you have to download the program **MANGA***, if you haven't done so already. To do this, go to the following website [**Link**](https://github.com/jbathmann/pyMANGA/ "https://github.com/jbathmann/pyMANGA/") and download the program as a zip file and save it on your computer (see Figure 3).

Then unzip the file (***pyMANGA-master.zip***) to your desktop. It contains all the program components of **MANGA**, including ***main.py***, which is the execution file that must be called to execute the program. To do so, open the **folder** and **right-click** in an empty area of the **folder** to open the command **prompt** (see Figure 4) and enter the following code.

	• py main.py -h								     		[5]

Again, ***py*** means Python is called, ***main.py*** represents the file to be called, and ***-h*** calls the help.

Note: The command **prompt** is called in the **folder** so that the **folder path** does not have to be entered each time. On Windows 10, this is only possible by downloading ***cmd add to context menu.zip*** from the following web page [**link**](https://www.giga.de/downloads/windows-10/tipps/windows-10-wieder-die-eingabeaufforderung-im-kontextmenue-anzeigen/ "https://www.giga.de/downloads/windows-10/tipps/windows-10-wieder-die- prompt in-context menu-display/") and running it as described on the page. Alternatively, you can use Command **Prompt**, which you can find in Windows **Search** with the search term **"Command Prompt"**, and specify the complete file path, which in this example is ***C:\Users\...\Desktop\pyMANGA-master***. To find your file path, **right-click** on the ***pyMANGA-master*** **folder** and go to **Properties**. Here you will find the information about the location of the folder to which you have to add a \ to the **name** of the **folder**.
