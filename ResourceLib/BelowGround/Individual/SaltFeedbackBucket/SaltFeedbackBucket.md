# Description

This module calculates the reduction in below-ground resource availability caused by pore water salinity below a plant, taking into account the feedback between plant water uptake and pore water salinity.
When a plant absorbs water from the soil, it leaves behind salt, which in turn increases the salt concentration below the plant, thereby reducing water availability to the plant.
This feedback is calculated assuming that each cell is an individual bucket (1D) that does not interact with its neighbors (i.e., there is no lateral or vertical flow in the soil).

The salinity in each bucket (cell) is based on the salinity and a mixing rate at the left and right boundaries of the model.
The mixing rate describes how much water in a cell is exchanged with incoming water (where the two may have different salinities).
The salinity is based on ``pyMANGA.BelowGround.Individual.FixedSalinity``, but takes into account the feedback between plant and soil.
There is no direct competition.

# Value

A list of values with length = number of plant.

Each value describes the availability of below-ground resources for a plant (dimensionless).
The factor ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating no limitations and 0 indicating full limitations.


# Details
## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to simulate the feedback between pore water salinity and plant water uptake.
When a plant takes up (fresh) water, the salinity remains in the soil, thus salinizing the soil.
This in turn makes it more difficult for the plant to take up water (i.e. reduces water availability).

## Process overview

Initialize the module
- *makeGrid*: create regular grid (see ``pyMANGA.ResourceLib``)
- *getBorderValues* Calculate the salinity and mixing rate at the left and right domain boundaries based on ``pyMANGA.BelowGround.Individual.FixedSalinity``.
- *getInflowSalinity*: calculate salinity in each cell
- *getInflowMixingRate*: calculate mixing rate in each cell
- *assignInitialCellSalinity*: get initial cell salinity

During each time step:
- *prepareNextTimeStep*: technical method
- *addPlant*: add plants to the resource matrix
- *calculateBelowgroundResources*: calculate below-ground factor

## Sub-processes
#### getInflowSalinity

The salinity at the boundaries of the model is calculated as described in ``pyMANGA.BelowGround.Individual.FixedSalinity``.

The salinity in each cell is linearly interpolated.
If the model domain consists of only 1 cell, the average of the left and right boundaries is taken.

#### getInflowMixingRate

The mixing rate in each cell (`r_mix_inflow`) is linearly interpolated based on the mixing rate at the left and right boundaries (`r_mix`).

#### assignInitialCellSalinity

If an initial cell salinity is provided as a text file, the file is read and the salinity is assigned.
The file needs to contain the salinity matrix of shape (row: y_resolution, col: x_resolution).
If this is not the case, salinity is calculated with *getInflowSalinity*.

#### addPlant

Add plant attributes such as position, size, and growth parameters to the resource module.

*getAffectedCellsIdx* returns the indices of cells affected by a plant.
Affected cells are those that are within the centers of the root plate radius.

It is assumed that the water uptake (``plant_water_uptake``, in mÂ³ per timestep) of a plant is uniformly distributed over all affected cells, defined by their area (`cell_area)` and number (`no_cells`).
Thus, the sink term (`sink_per_cell`, in m per s) of each cell is
````python
sink_per_cell = plant_water_uptake / (cell_area * no_cells) / timesteplength
````

#### calculateBelowgroundResources

- *getBorderValues* Calculate the salinity and mixing rate at the left and right domain boundaries based on ``pyMANGA.BelowGround.Individual.FixedSalinity``.
- *getInflowSalinity* Calculate the inflowing salinity in each cell using linear interpolation (see method *getInflowSalinity*).
- *calculateCellSalinity* Calculate the salinity of the current time step using a simple bucket model approach (see below).
- *getPlantSalinity* Calculate mean cell salinity of affected cells for each plant (``salinity_plant``)
- *calculatePlantResources* Calculate salinity below each plant based on ``pyMANGA.BelowGround.Individual.FixedSalinity``.
- *writeGridSalinity* Write grid cell salinity to a text file.

##### getBorderValues

Calculate salinity and mixing rate at left and right boundaries.

If a sine function is defined in the input file, it can be applied to both salinity and mixing rate, or separately. 
By default, it is applied to salinity only.
For the calculation see ``pyMANGA.ResourceLib.BelowGround.Individual.FixedSalinity``.

##### calculateCellSalinity

Salinity in each cell is calculated assuming a simple water bucket approach, where each cell is an independent bucket with the following characteristics:
- fully saturated
- outflow: water extraction through plant, with salinity = 0
- inflow: water inflow, with salinity = variable

````python
ht = exp(- r_mix_inflow / depth * timesteplength)
sal_cell = sal_cell * ht + (vol_sink_cell + r_mix_inflow) / r_mix_inflow * sal_cell_inflow * (1 - ht)
````

#### writeGridSalinity

The salinity of each cell is written to a txt file at the end of a time step, if defined in the project file.
The file contains the salinity matrix of shape (row: y_resolution, col: x_resolution)
